      info: If you send a message via email, every network operator and your email provider can (and probably do) read it. Instead, you should put your message into a self-destructive tape and send the recipient a link to where this tape can be downloaded. This way, your email provider cannot read your message unless he would actually open the link to the tape, which you sent via email. But the link is self-destrucitve. This means that when somebody intercepted the tape and read it, your original recipient would no longer be able to read it. In that case, the message would be compromised, but you would know it as soon as the legitimate recipient would try to read it and see a warning message instead. Self-destructive tapes are meant for messages that are not terribly important if compromised, but there is still considerably more privacy than when you would send your message in plain-text directly via email. Note that you cannot send the link for the tape to several people, because only the first person will be able to open it. In case you do need more security, consider sending a "message in a safe" instead. There you can add a password and also upload attachments.

      info: If you send a message via email, every network operator and your email provider can (and probably do) read it. That's why the sender of this tape put the message into a self-destructive tape and sent you a link to download it. This way, your email provider cannot read the message unless he would actually open the link to the tape. But the link is self-destructive. This means that when somebody else would have intercepted the tape, you would not have been able to read it as you do right now. Since you opened this tape, it has been removed from our sever and the link you received will not work any longer. As long as you don't leave this page, you can download the tape as a text file by clicking on "download". If you would like to, you can reply to this message by creating a new tape yourself. Just click on "back to the main menu" and then on "self-destructive tape" for more instructions.

      info: If you send a message via email, every network operator and your email provider can (and probably do) read it. That's why the sender of this tape put a message for you into a self-destructive tape and sent you a link to download it. This way, your email provider cannot read the message unless he would actually open the link to the tape. Unfortunately, somebody has already clicked on the link to read this tape and it was thus destroyed. Maybe it was just a mistake and the sender coincidently opened his own tape, or maybe you have already read it some time before. In the worst case, somebody has actually intercepted the tape and it was compromised. Please contact the sender of this tape so that you can make sure whether it was just a mistake, or whether somebody else read the message which was intended for you.

      info_headline: Information about self-destructive files
      info: If you send a file as attachment in an email, every network operator and your email provider can (and probably do) read it. Instead, you should upload your file as a self-destructive file and send the recipient a link to where the file can be downloaded. This way, your email provider cannot download your attachment unless he would actually open the link to the file, which you sent via email. But the link is self-destructive. This means that when somebody intercepted the link and downloaded the file, your original recipient would no longer be able to download it. In that case, the file would be compromised, but you would know it as soon as the legitimate recipient would try to download it and see a warning message instead. So, self-destructive files are no guarantee that nobody can intercept them, but there is still considerably more privacy than when you would send your file as an attachment directly via email. Note that you cannot send the link for the file to several people, because only the first person will be able to download it. In case you do need more security, consider sending a "message in a safe" instead. You can upload a file there as well, but secure it with an additional password.

This way, your email provider cannot get the file unless he would actually open the link to this download. Unfortunately, somebody has already clicked on the link to download this file and it was thus destroyed. Maybe it was just a mistake and the sender coincidently opened his own link, or maybe you have already downloaded it before. In the worst case, somebody has actually intercepted the link and the file was illicitly downloaded.

      info_headline: Information about messages in a safe
      info: If you send a message via email, every network operator and your email provider can (and probably do) read it. Instead, you should put your message into a password-protected safe and send the recipient a link to where this safe can be opened. This way, only people who have both the link and the password, can read the message. Of course, you would first have to agree on a password that the recipient(s) must know for opening the message. Note that the message in the safe will be deleted after two weeks - whether it has been read or not. When opening the message, the user has the option to delete the message, to download it, or to download the attached file. If you sent the message to several people and one deleted the message, the others won't be able to read the message any longer. Just a hint on how you could agree on a password (other than via the phone, of course) - consider sending a self-destructive tape suggesting a password. You can do this from the main menu.
